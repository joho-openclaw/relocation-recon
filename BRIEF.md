# Relocation Recon — Research Brief

## Who
- Josh & Candace — both remote workers, no kids yet, no pets yet (possible future dog)
- Interracial couple (Candace is Black)
- Currently in Monrovia, CA (greater LA area)
- This is a 1-2 year adventure move, not permanent

## Priority Framework (ranked)
1. **Racial climate & diversity** — Welcoming to interracial couples, inclusive community feel. Not about demographics specifically, but how the area *treats* diversity.
2. **Safety & stability** — Candace's baseline is San Diego. Physical safety, low crime neighborhoods. She is very safety-conscious.
3. **Political moderation** — Not far-right (concern about Texas-style politics), not dysfunctionally progressive (concern about Portland/SF-style crime/homelessness)
4. **Cost of living** — Lower than SoCal. Want to stretch dollars further. Budget is flexible but prefer savings.
5. **Walkability** — Safe, walkable neighborhoods. Urban or suburban fine.
6. **Scenic beauty** — Mountains, hills, natural "backdrop." Candace is used to San Diego scenery.
7. **Seasons / climate** — Candace wants to experience real seasons. Snow is not a dealbreaker.
8. **Culture & character** — Place needs to have a *feel*, an identity. No cookie-cutter suburbs. Not nightlife-focused, but culturally rich.

## Constraints
- US only
- Coast to coast is fine
- Size flexible (not tiny-town, not Manhattan-dense)
- Airport proximity not critical (twice-a-year family visits)
- No commute requirements

## Cities Already on Radar
- Denver, CO
- Charlotte, NC

## Candace's Reservations
- Florida — political climate concerns (partly stereotype-based)
- Texas — same
- Very progressive cities with high crime/homelessness (Portland, SF)

## Josh's Background
- Grew up in Jacksonville, FL → Chicago → California
- Hiked 500 miles of Appalachian Trail
- Bohemian, wanderlust, loves hiking and walking
- Appreciates lower COL from FL experience

## Deliverable
- Static site (HTML/CSS/JS) with city profiles
- Structured JSON data files per city
- Neighborhood-level detail where possible
- Comparison views, scoring, visual design
- Deploy to OpenClaw canvas for preview, GitHub Pages for sharing
