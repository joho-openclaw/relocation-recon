  "saturday": "You wake up in your West Asheville bungalow to crisp mountain air and walk to Sunny Point Cafe, where the huevos rancheros are legendary. After breakfast, you drive the Blue Ridge Parkway, stopping at overlooks where the mountains fold into infinity—fall colors or spring blooms painting the ridgelines. By afternoon, you're hiking Rattlesnake Lodge trail or browsing the River Arts District studios, watching glass-blowers and potters work. Dinner is at Jerusalem Garden Cafe for warm pita and falafel, then you stroll downtown through the South Slope brewery district. As evening settles, you sit on your porch with a local IPA, watching the mountains fade to silhouette, feeling grateful for the beauty even if the homogeneity nags at you.",
