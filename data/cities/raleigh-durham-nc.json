    "summary": "HIGHLY INTEGRATED: The Research Triangle may be the best-integrated metro on this list. Three major universities (Duke, UNC, NC State) create a knowledge-economy culture where cross-racial professional and social mixing is the norm, not the exception. Black professionals are well-represented in tech, academia, and healthcare — not siloed into specific neighborhoods. Durham especially has deep Black cultural roots AND genuine integration. Interracial couples are common and comfortable. The university influence means people are used to diversity as lived experience, not just a value statement. Residential integration is strong in neighborhoods like downtown Durham, Hillsborough, and parts of Cary. San Diego-level comfort with more visible Black community presence.",

Afternoon finds you strolling the American Tobacco Campus or hiking the Eno River trails. Dinner reservations at Taverna Agora in downtown Raleigh bring Greek mezze and rooftop views. By evening, you're back in Durham at a brewery or catching live music, surrounded by interracial couples and feeling utterly at home. This place just works.",
