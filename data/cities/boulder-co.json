The infamous 2019 incident — a Black student detained by 8 cops for picking up trash — crystallizes the gap between Boulder's self-image and lived experience. With only ~1% Black population, Candace would be conspicuously visible everywhere. Social spaces are overwhelmingly white. The progressivism is genuine in intent but doesn't translate to integrated community — it's 'we support diversity' while living in a 95%+ white bubble. Cross-racial social mixing barely exists because there's almost no one to mix with. An interracial couple would be 'accepted' intellectually but would lack the comfort of being unremarkable. Boulder is the definition of well-meaning homogeneity.",

After a stunning hike, you descend to Pearl Street Mall for brunch at Snooze (wait: 45 minutes, worth it). The afternoon is spent browsing bookstores and gear shops, then you bike Boulder Creek Path past joggers, dogs, and families. Dinner at Sherpa's Adventureland brings Tibetan momos and dal bhat, then you catch sunset at Flagstaff Mountain—the plains stretching to infinity. Boulder is fitness-obsessed, educated, expensive, and stunningly beautiful. You question if you belong in the bubble, but the mountains argue persuasively.",
