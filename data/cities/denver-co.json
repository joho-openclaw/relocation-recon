Cross-racial social mixing happens naturally in Capitol Hill, RiNo, Highlands, and Five Points. The multi-generational Black community (~9%) provides cultural infrastructure. However, integration is uneven: some neighborhoods are genuinely mixed while others (particularly outer suburbs and newer developments) remain quite white. The racism is 'passive not blatant' — microaggressions, assumptions, but not hostility. Candace would find comfortable integrated spaces in the urban core but may notice the whiteness in certain contexts. Denver's integration is real but requires choosing the right neighborhood. Compared to San Diego's effortless mixing, Denver requires slightly more intentionality.",

The evening finds you at a Highlands brewery, chatting with transplants from everywhere, the diversity palpable and comfortable.
