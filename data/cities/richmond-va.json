    "summary": "RECKONING AND INTEGRATING: Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy, and that weight is real. But the city is actively transforming — Monument Avenue's Confederate statues were removed, and younger residents are building genuinely integrated communities. The Fan, Carytown, Scott's Addition, and Church Hill have real cross-racial mixing, especially among younger demographics. However, deep historical segregation patterns persist in many neighborhoods. Richmond has a large Black population (~46% city) but residential integration varies dramatically block by block. An interracial couple would be comfortable in the progressive urban core but would encounter the legacy of segregation in neighborhood patterns. The integration is genuine where it exists but the city is still mid-journey.",

By evening, you're at the South of the James Farmers Market, then dinner at L'Opossum (fine dining with a sense of humor).
