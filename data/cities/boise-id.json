  "saturday": "You wake up in the North End to high desert sunshine and bike the Boise Greenbelt—25 miles of paved riverside trail through the city. Coffee at Dawson's downtown, then you hike Table Rock for panoramic views of the Treasure Valley. By afternoon, you're exploring the Basque Block, learning about Boise's unique European heritage, then lunch at Bar Gernika for croquetas and Basque cider. The evening is spent at the Hyde Park Street Fair (if it's summer) or a brewery in the East End. Boise is safe, sunny, affordable, and outdoorsy. But you'd be one of very few Black residents, and Idaho politics loom heavy.",
