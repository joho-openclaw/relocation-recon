    "summary": "DIFFERENT PARADIGM: Albuquerque operates outside the Black/white racial binary that defines most American cities. It's 48% Hispanic, 37% White, 4% Black, 5% Native American — the majority-minority dynamics create a fundamentally different racial landscape. Reddit users note there 'just isn't the legacy of black vs. white here, making it far more safe and equitable for people of color.' The small Black community means Candace would be visible, but the context is different — she'd be in a city where being non-white is the norm, not the exception. Integration happens along different axes (Hispanic/Native/White mixing is deeply rooted). Interracial couples of all combinations are common. The risk is that the small Black community means less cultural infrastructure specifically for Black Americans. But the absence of the traditional American racial hierarchy is genuinely liberating for many who move here.",

  "saturday": "You wake up in your Nob Hill casita to 310-days-of-sunshine doing their thing, the Sandia Mountains already turning gold. Coffee at Zendo (locally roasted, excellent), then you walk Central Avenue's Route 66 strip — murals, vintage shops, and the smell of roasting green chile drifting from every direction. By mid-morning you're hiking La Luz trail up the Sandias, the city sprawling below like a map. Back down for a late lunch at El Pinto (red chile enchiladas under cottonwood trees) or Frontier (legendary New Mexican diner across from UNM). Afternoon wanders through Old Town's adobe plaza, galleries, and the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. Dinner is Frenchish (Nob Hill, creative bistro) or Farm & Table (farm-to-table with mountain views). You end the evening at the Rail Yards Market or a Marble Brewery patio, watching the Sandias turn their famous watermelon pink as the sun sets. Albuquerque is strange and beautiful and cheap and alive.",
