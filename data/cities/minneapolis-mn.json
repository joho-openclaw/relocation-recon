The morning is spent biking the Chain of Lakes—Lake Calhoun to Lake Harriet—fall colors reflected in glassy water. By afternoon, you're browsing the Midtown Global Market, sampling Somali sambusas and Hmong spring rolls, the international community palpable and vibrant. Dinner at Trieste Cafe downtown brings Mediterranean mezze, then you catch a show at the Guthrie Theater overlooking the Mississippi River.
