# Scoring Methodology

## Overview

Each city is scored across 8 categories on a 1-10 scale. Scores are weighted by priority to produce a composite ranking. The framework is designed for **Josh & Candace** — an interracial couple (she's Black) looking for a 1-2 year adventure move from SoCal.

**Baseline reference: San Diego, CA** — not included as a city option, but used as calibration. San Diego represents roughly a **7** for integration, a **6** for safety, and the standard for scenery and climate they're accustomed to.

## Scoring Categories

### 1. Diversity & Integration Climate (Weight: 9)

**What it measures:** True social integration — not just demographic diversity, but how integrated daily life actually is for an interracial couple.

This is NOT a demographics score. A city that's 50% Black but deeply segregated scores lower than a city that's 15% Black with genuinely mixed neighborhoods.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Essentially no integration possible. Tiny or nonexistent Black community. May face hostility. |
| 3-4 | Accepted but isolated. Very few Black residents. Progressive values but no community to integrate into. "Welcomed visitor" status. |
| 5-6 | Meaningful diversity exists but integration is uneven. Some mixed neighborhoods, some segregated. Passive racism may occur. Interracial couples comfortable but may need to choose neighborhoods carefully. |
| 7-8 | Genuinely integrated. Interracial couples are unremarkable. Cross-racial social mixing happens naturally. Strong Black community presence. Multiple integrated neighborhoods to choose from. |
| 9-10 | Deeply integrated society. Race is not a defining social boundary. Interracial couples are the norm. All neighborhoods are mixed. Community institutions are integrated. |

**Key factors evaluated:**
- Residential integration (mixed neighborhoods vs. parallel communities)
- Interracial couple visibility and comfort (do you get stares? or are you unremarkable?)
- Cross-cultural social mixing (do different races socialize together, or coexist separately?)
- Absence of both overt AND passive racism (microaggressions count)
- Black community infrastructure (churches, businesses, cultural institutions)
- Police interaction patterns (profiling documented?)

**San Diego baseline (~7):** Diverse, interracial couples common and unremarkable, cross-racial mixing happens naturally in most neighborhoods. Not perfect (some segregation exists) but integration is largely effortless.

### 2. Safety (Weight: 8)

**What it measures:** Physical safety, particularly for Candace (whose baseline is San Diego).

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Dangerous. High violent crime across most areas. Few safe neighborhoods. |
| 3-4 | Elevated crime. Safe neighborhoods exist but require careful selection. City-wide statistics are concerning. |
| 5-6 | Moderate crime. Safe neighborhoods are available and accessible. Some areas to avoid. Typical mid-size city. |
| 7-8 | Low crime. Most neighborhoods feel safe. Violent crime is uncommon. Comfortable for safety-conscious residents. |
| 9-10 | Very safe. Low crime across the board. Walking alone at night is comfortable citywide. |

**Data sources:** FBI UCR data, NeighborhoodScout, CrimeGrade.org, local police statistics, violent crime rates per 100K.

### 3. Political Moderation (Weight: 7)

**What it measures:** Political climate that's neither far-right (hostile to diversity) nor dysfunctionally progressive (crime/homelessness issues from policy failures).

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Extreme politics in either direction. Hostile to their values or dysfunctionally governed. |
| 3-4 | Significant political concerns. State or city politics may create uncomfortable situations. |
| 5-6 | Leans one direction but manageable. Some political friction but livable. |
| 7-8 | Moderate and pragmatic. Politics don't dominate daily life. Governance is functional. |
| 9-10 | Ideal balance. Inclusive policies, functional government, low political tension. |

### 4. Cost of Living (Weight: 6)

**What it measures:** Affordability compared to SoCal (the whole point is stretching dollars further).

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | More expensive than LA. No savings. |
| 3-4 | Slightly cheaper but marginal savings. Expensive for the region. |
| 5-6 | Moderate savings. 15-25% below LA. Noticeable but not dramatic. |
| 7-8 | Significant savings. 25-40% below LA. $500-1,000/month saved. |
| 9-10 | Major savings. 40%+ below LA. $1,000+/month saved. Dramatically more affordable. |

**Data sources:** BestPlaces.net, PayScale, median rent data (1BR and 2BR), cost of living indices vs. national average.

### 5. Walkability (Weight: 5)

**What it measures:** Ability to live without constant car dependence. Safe, pleasant walking to daily needs.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Completely car-dependent. Nothing walkable. |
| 3-4 | Mostly car-dependent. A few walkable pockets but daily errands require driving. |
| 5-6 | Somewhat walkable. Best neighborhoods score 70+ on Walk Score. Car helpful but not required for everything. |
| 7-8 | Walkable core. Multiple neighborhoods where car-free living is comfortable. Good transit options. |
| 9-10 | Highly walkable. Many neighborhoods support car-free living. Excellent transit. |

**Data sources:** Walk Score, neighborhood-level walk scores, transit availability.

### 6. Scenic Beauty (Weight: 4)

**What it measures:** Visual drama and natural beauty. Mountains, water, natural "backdrop."

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Flat, unremarkable. No natural features of note. |
| 3-4 | Pleasant but not dramatic. Generic suburban/urban landscape. |
| 5-6 | Nice scenery. Some natural features but not breathtaking. |
| 7-8 | Beautiful. Notable natural features — hills, rivers, coast. Regular "wow" moments. |
| 9-10 | Spectacular. World-class natural beauty. Mountains, dramatic landscapes, or stunning coastline. Daily awe. |

### 7. Climate (Weight: 3)

**What it measures:** Weather quality and seasonal experience. Candace wants to experience real seasons.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Extreme climate. Dangerous heat/cold for extended periods. |
| 3-4 | Challenging seasons. Harsh winters or brutal summers significantly impact quality of life. |
| 5-6 | Mixed. Real seasons exist but one season is tough (very cold winters or very hot summers). |
| 7-8 | Pleasant. Four seasons with manageable extremes. Good sunshine. Comfortable most of the year. |
| 9-10 | Ideal. Mild year-round with distinct seasons. Comfortable outdoors most days. Abundant sunshine. |

### 8. Culture & Character (Weight: 2)

**What it measures:** Does the place have a "feel"? Identity, arts, food, community character.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1-2 | Generic. No discernible identity. Could be anywhere. |
| 3-4 | Some character but thin. Limited cultural offerings. |
| 5-6 | Has identity. Some cultural scene. Local character exists but may be narrow. |
| 7-8 | Strong identity. Rich cultural scene, good food, arts, music. The city feels like "somewhere." |
| 9-10 | Exceptional character. World-class cultural offerings. Deeply unique identity. Nationally recognized food/arts/music scene. |

## Weighted Scoring

The composite score uses the priority framework:

| Priority | Category | Weight |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Diversity & Integration | 9 |
| 2 | Safety | 8 |
| 3 | Political Moderation | 7 |
| 4 | Cost of Living | 6 |
| 5 | Walkability | 5 |
| 6 | Scenic Beauty | 4 |
| 7 | Climate | 3 |
| 8 | Culture & Character | 2 |

**Formula:** Weighted Score = Σ(score × weight) / Σ(weights)

The website also offers a **custom weighting tool** where you can adjust weights to match your own priorities.

## Important Notes

1. **Scores are subjective but researched.** Every score is backed by data and community reports, but ultimately reflects judgment about what matters for Josh & Candace specifically.

2. **Integration ≠ Demographics.** A city with 50% Black population but deep segregation scores lower than a city with 15% Black population and genuine mixing. We're measuring how it *feels* to live there as an interracial couple, not census percentages.

3. **San Diego as baseline.** All scores are calibrated against what Josh & Candace know — San Diego represents "comfortable normal" for integration (~7), safety (~6), scenery (~9), and climate (~9).

4. **Neighborhood matters more than city.** Every city has safe and unsafe areas, walkable and car-dependent neighborhoods. The scores reflect what's achievable by choosing the right neighborhood, not city-wide averages alone.

5. **These scores are a starting point.** Visit before deciding. Talk to locals. Walk the neighborhoods. Data can only tell you so much.
