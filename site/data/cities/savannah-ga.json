  "saturday": "You wake up in the Victorian District to Spanish moss swaying outside your window and walk to The Collins Quarter for avocado smash and flat whites. The morning is spent wandering Forsyth Park and the Historic District's squares—live oaks dripping with moss, fountains, architecture that makes you stop and stare. By afternoon, you drive to Tybee Island for beach time and fresh shrimp, then back to Starland District for gallery-hopping. Dinner is at Olympia Cafe on River Street—Greek food overlooking the Savannah River as cargo ships glide past. Evening finds you at a SCAD student art show or sipping cocktails at a rooftop bar, the humid night air thick with possibility. Savannah feels like nowhere else—haunted, beautiful, and unapologetically Southern.",

SCAD students add international variety, but this is the Deep South—fried food and sweet tea reign.",
    "grocery_quality": "Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Brighter Day Natural Foods Market (co-op), Publix. Solid grocery access for the city size, but fewer specialty international options than larger metros."
